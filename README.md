# Education Platform - Frontend

**Aug 2024 - Oct 2024**

## Description:

Developed the **frontend** for a comprehensive education platform offering tracks and courses. Each course includes multiple interactive components such as **topics**, **milestones**, **quizzes**, **assignments**, and a **final project**. Gamification elements were integrated to enhance user engagement and motivation throughout the learning process.

## Key Features:
- **Course Management Interface**: Allows users to browse and interact with courses, tracks, and milestones.
- **Gamification**: Badges, levels, and progress tracking to keep users motivated and engaged.
- **Interactive Learning**: Real-time feedback, quizzes, assignments, and projects for a rich learning experience.
- **OAuth Authentication**: Secure login through **GitHub OAuth** for easy access to the platform.

## Technologies Used:

- **Frontend**: 
  - **React.js**: Used to build dynamic, component-based user interfaces and handle routing.
  - **Tailwind CSS**: For fast, utility-first styling to create a modern, responsive design.

- **Authentication**:
  - **OAuth**: User authentication handled using **GitHub OAuth**, enabling smooth login for users via their GitHub accounts.

- **API Communication**:
  - **Axios**: Used to handle API requests to the backend to fetch and manage course data, user progress, and more.

- **Real-time Features**:
  - WebSocket or **Firebase** may be used for instant messaging and notifications (or another real-time communication setup as needed).
